No application can do all things. All design decisions involve tradeoffs.
TrueBlocks tries to make trade off _consciously_, so that we always
make the application best serve our core values.

These core values underlie every single commit made to the TrueBlocks codebase.


## Mantras for decentralized data
We keep an ongoing list of mantras that, if repeated endlessly, will eventually sink in:

* All the data, for all the people, all the time, but no data if the user doesn’t want it
* Use only consented-to data…
    * If you can’t do that, use only data derived directly from consented-to data
    * If you can’t do that, find a way to force the data provider to prove their data
* The paradigm has shifted, embrace it - the server is now called localhost
* Break yourself out of the browser. There’s a big wide desktop out there
* It’s easier to scale up than to scale down - decentralize first
* Most users care only about themselves and maybe a few smart contracts
* Some users, but not all, care about everything
* Everyone needs to do accounting and pay taxes
* The node can, and should be, be improved
