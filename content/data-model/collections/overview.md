TrueBlocks Data collections are built progressively.
Each grouping comprises a building block on which another grouping is created.

## Accounts

_Accounts_ are a combination of `addresses` and `names`.

## Collections are lists of accounts

For example, a user might have a collection called "Jay's World" that includes the following accounts:
* gitcoin account
* Business account
* personal ethereum account
* wife's account


Using collections allows you to monitor a series of accounts.

## Monitors actively update collections

If you try to locally monitor every account on a blockchain, you will quickly encounter
storage issues.
To allow you to watch _only the accounts you are interested in_, TrueBlocks offers a data called a monitor.

A _Monitor_ is an [account](#account) or [collection](#collection) that
TrueBlocks continually watches for new transactions.

## A name is a well-known account

## Tags let you create associations

Through tags, you can associate different objects together. For example:

## Funcssigs

## Event sigs
