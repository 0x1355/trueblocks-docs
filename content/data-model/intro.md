Underlying all TrueBlocks data─and therefore all Ethereum data─is a set of inter-related data models.
No matter whether you use TrueBlocks through the CLI, API, or GUI app, the underlying data is the same.

TrueBlocks provides clarity in the great relations of the blockchain.
But, to understand the relations, you have to understand what words, like "tokens", "ABI", and "names" mean.

This reference describes the overarching data model.
