The results of this extraction are stored in a data structure called a Monitor.
Monitors collect together Appearances (blknum.tx_id pairs) along with additional information such as Reconciliations (18-decimal place accurate accounting for each asset transfer), Names (associations of human-readable names with addresses), and Abis which track the &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; of each transaction through its Functions and Parameters.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Ethereum Data</title><link>/data-model/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:40:11 -0300</pubDate><guid>/data-model/intro/</guid><description>Blockchain + people = TrueBlocks-enhanced data Broadly, the data TrueBlocks provides divides into two categories:
Blockchain data Account-organized data On its own Ethereum blockchain data is just a boring blob of bytes. What really interests us are the stories behind this data&amp;ndash;questions like:
What addresses were involved? Can I see all transactions involved this address? When did the transaction happen? What smart contracts were involved? Through TrueBlock&amp;rsquo;s --articulate option, you can unpack the input fields of transactions and trace through the whole history of contract calls.</description></item><item><title>The Index</title><link>/data-model/the-index/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 09:35:59 -0300</pubDate><guid>/data-model/the-index/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Chain Data</title><link>/data-model/chaindata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:27:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/data-model/chaindata/</guid><description>_These fields describe the output of various TrueBlocks blockchain queries.

State The balance of an address at a given block.

chifra quotes, a rudimentary pricing tool, chifra explore a quick way to open a blockchain explorer, ethslurp an older tool that lets you call data from EtherScan. (This has issues of ceentralization and data quality, see explanation in its section). ðŸ‘‰ Note: some of these tools, like `ethslurp`, require an EtherScan key.
